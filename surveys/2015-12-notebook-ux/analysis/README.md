# An Analysis of the Jupyter Notebook UX Survey

This folder contains a set of notebooks and data files that, together, represent an analysis done by @parente and @jtyberg of the Jupyter Notebook UX survey data found in the parent folder.

There are numerous ways to consume the results. If you are reading this on GitHub, get started by opening the [report dashboard notebook](report_dashboard.ipynb) and reading the initial sections. If you want a more interactive experience, see the *About this Notebook* section in the notebook for options.
