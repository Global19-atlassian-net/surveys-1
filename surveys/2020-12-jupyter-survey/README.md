# 2020 Jupyter Survey

This folder contains data from the 2020 Jupyter Survey lead by Layne Sadler (@layne-sadler). It includes:
- [all_responses.csv](./data/all_responses.csv) A CSV file containing all responses from multiple choice or matrix questions.
- [text_fields.csv](./data/text_fields.csv) A CSV file containing all responses from text fields.
- [all_responses.ipynb](./all_responses.ipynb) A notebook containing visualizations and analysis from all_responses.csv and text_fields.csv. It requires Python 3.7+ with pandas and ploty_express which are imported at the top of the notebook. It also requires [jupyterlab-plotly](https://www.npmjs.com/package/jupyterlab-plotly) which can be installed with`jupyter labextension install jupyterlab-plotly`.
- [all_responses.html](./all_responses.html) An HTML version of all_responses.ipynb.

Responses were collected on [SurveyMonkey](https://www.surveymonkey.com/) from December 2020 to February 2021. This survey was open to anyone familiar with Project Jupyter with more direct outreach to those involved in the Jupyter ecosystem, current and former. It was advertised on the [Jupyter blog](https://blog.jupyter.org/), [Project Jupyter Google Group](https://groups.google.com/g/jupyter/), [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com), [binder](https://mybinder.org/), the [Project Jupyter website](https://jupyter.org/), [Jupyter Discourse](https://discourse.jupyter.org/), and [Project Jupyter Twitter](https://twitter.com/ProjectJupyter).

## Background
This survey was made in response to discussions at [jupyterlab/team-compass #80](https://github.com/jupyterlab/team-compass/issues/80) and was intended to help provide a better sense of the community outside of development-centered meetings and places. It was also meant to help guide the [JupyterLab 4.0](https://github.com/jupyterlab/jupyterlab/issues/9647) roadmap.
