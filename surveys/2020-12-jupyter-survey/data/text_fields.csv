So I've decided to wait for a year or two and hope that at some point, you can just install one thing and it will let you explore the data (something similar to pandas-profiling) without the need to install tons of plugins.

Git-tability is close to zero and even working with notebook as source e.g. during refactoring .py codebase is not a solved problem.    My closest solution now is pycharm pro - they have ok support for code writing and auto-completion/type-checks, but it hangs a lot, eats tons of memory for notebooks.     Other pain point is switching between servers. It is commonly assumed that notebook should be on the server, and for development/analytics it is a very wrong aassumption (I have to switch between machines when I need e.g much memory for genomics, or to gpu instances when doing computer vision, while some monitoring/simple analyses can be done on my machine).

The XPython debugger is a great teaching tool that could use a bit of polish.   3.

Concurrency control is not good - run a ML training cell and a visualization cell in parallel.  Inconsistencies in single-kernel vs multiple-browser model.  Challenging APIs - how to show a side-by-side comparison? And compatibility breaks frequently.  Larger media needs to be outputted to a separate stream (such as a network drive or VNC server).

I've tried to use JupyterLab but really don't like it - I would be happy to share more thoughts if you're interested.  The primary issue is that I find the UI cluttered with features that aren't important to me, i.e. the filesystem bar (I prefer the Jupyter solution, which is to have it in a separate tab in my browser.) I also don't use the csv preview feature, as I'd prefer to read my data into pandas, which already displays beautifully in Jupyter.  Similarly, a variable explorer is uninteresting to me.  I can see how these features would all be helpful to a beginner, but to more of a ""power user,"" they just clutter the interface."

Add an option to show/strip trailing whitespace in the text editor and notebook cells. Maybe by supporting EditorConfig? Cf. issue #3904.  2. The Copy Path command is currently not really useful, see issue #9485 for an explanation why and ideas for improvement.    These will probably be harder but would be awesome to have:    1. The ability to start a long-running command/notebook etc., close the JupyterLab browser tab / put the computer to sleep, re-open JupyterLab later and see the output that was generated in the meantime. AFAIK, this requires changes to the kernel protocol. Cf. issue #2833.  2. Improve the text editor, so that the UX when writing scripts is more on par with that of using notebooks. Code evaluation is already available, which is great (though it can be hard to discover), so this mostly means auto-completion (i.e. probably LSP integration?). Cf. issues #2972, #2163."

My workflow typically uses Jupyter notebooks for either early exploratory work, or more mature demos/examples/experiments/reports, with the main development part in the middle writing a Python package for the notebook to call.  However making sure demos/examples/reports stay in sync as api and code changes in the package progress is tricky, and usually needs an extra layer of automation in place to rerun a series of notebooks as a kind of smoke test. However smaller (non breaking) changes in outputs are much harder/manual to detect.  Unit tests are a great way to make sure package code is valid, but as the notebook itself is often the deliverable (or an export thereof), need to make sure it is still using the package code correctly.

Some extensions, like the variable browser for Python / R, should probably be polished and included by default to make things easy for beginners. This is the key request/complaint I get from RStudio users when I teach Python in Jupyterlab.    An IPython REPL (console) attached to the interpreter of the running Python kernel would be great too.    With a few of these quality-of-life improvements Jupyterlab could easily displace proprietary tools like RStudio for both Python and R users.  "

In my current experience jupyter notebooks don't fit into a production data pipeline. We need end-to-end tests and checks, version control on all production code, relatively fast execution speed, and transparency of stack traces on exceptions/errors in production pipelines.    The best dev-to-prod workflow I've found is  - writing code in editor and executing in ipython terminal  - iterate to good solution  - push code as feature pr  - deploy etc    I tried including jupyter in the 1st step, but transitioning a notebook to production code I can submit as a pr is more busy work than writing the code in a .py file from the outset.    Reducing the barriers to extracting pr-ready code from a notebook would help me include jupyter in my workflow."
